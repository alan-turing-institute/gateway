Welcome to Simulate
===================

`Simulate <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/simulate>`_ is a  web  application for running simulations  either  in the  cloud  or on other computing  infrastructures.

Background
----------
Simulations are useful in a huge number of disciplines, from medical research to insurance to astronomy.
Setting up such simulations and visualising their results can be extremely complex and require considerable computing power.

Often users wanting to run simulations are experts in their particular industrial or scientific fields, but not experts in the complex simulation software or the computing platforms required to run them effectively. As a result the real-world use of such software in industry is low.

To tackle this problem, software engineers at The Alan Turing Institute, in collaboration with partners at Imperial College and UCL, have developed Simulate which aims to make the simulation process more user-friendly, and link seamlessly with cloud-based supercomputing. The tool has the potential to make running, visualising, sharing, and reproducing simulations simpler, for both academic and industrial communities.
